                        <h2>What's The Future Of The Ocean?</h2>
                        <p>Do you know, that the Oceans cover more than two thirds of Earth’s surface. They are home to millions of species, provide a key source of protein to people on every continent, and play an enormous role in regulating our planet’s climate, water cycle and more. They also are facing tremendous disruption from human action, from altered temperature and circulation to overfishing to acidification to plastic pollution, and the value of a plastic garbage truck is thrown into the sea every minute. A sailor named Dame Ellen MacArthur, who sailed more oceans than anyone else. She warned that if industries and people do not stop polluting the ocean, there will be more plastic waste in the sea than fish by 2050. About seven million tonnes of waste is dumped into the world's seas and oceans each year. Car tires, bottles, plastic bags, fishing nets are among the most common waste. It is estimated that this affects will kill more than 600 species of marine fauna, from whales to turtles, and even birds, and that 100,000 marine mammals die every year from garbage!

                    <h2> 1. Most of the Earth‚Äôs oxygen is produced by the Ocean</h2>
                    <p>Scientists agree that there‚Äôs oxygen from ocean plants in every breath we take. Most of this oxygen comes from tiny ocean plants called phytoplankton that live near the water‚Äôs surface and drift with the currents. Like all plants, they photosynthesize, that is, they use sunlight and carbon dioxide to make food. A byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen. Phytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web, the primary producers, feeding everything from microscopic, animal-like zooplankton to multi-ton whales. Small fish and invertebrates also graze on the plant-like organisms, and then those smaller animals are eaten by bigger ones.</p>

The componets of the ocean water is the Chlorine, Sodium, Magnesium, Sulfur, Calcium, and so many other. Did you know the salt on oceans water comes from mineral deposits that find their way to the ocean through the water cycle. We can see the percentage of each on the graphic below.</p>

Did you know that many drugs are now being developed from coral reef animals and plants as possible cures for cancer, arthritis, human bacterial infections, viruses, and others. Coral reefs support the economic from jobs, like fishing, and a lot of turism from people all around the world. By one estimate, the total net benefit per year of the world's coral reefs is $29.8 billion.</p>

The Ring of Fire is a roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and seismically active sites that outline the Pacific Ocean. Also known as the Circum-Pacific Belt, the Ring of Fire traces the meeting points of many tectonic plates, including the Eurasian, North American, Juan de Fuca, Cocos, Caribbean, Nazca, Antarctic, Indian, Australian, Philippine, and other smaller plates, which all encircle the large Pacific Plate. The Pacific Ocean it has some of the strongest hurricanes ever seen in the world! For example, the Super Typhoon Mangkhut, Philippines, In 2008, the biggest hurricane in the year. The name ‚ÄúPacific Ocean‚Äù comes form the Latin name Tepre Pacificum, ‚Äúpeaceful sea‚Äù.</p>

                        <p>Tsunamis are triggered by seismic events and can, according to Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, move across the ocean at speeds of 500 miles km/h when the ocean depth is 3.7 miles. These waves are usually unnoticed, as they are only a few inches above the surface. And as the waves move towards land‚Äîand the depths shrink‚Äîthey pick up water and increase in above-surface size. Megatsunamis have quite different features from other, more usual types of tsunamis. Most tsunamis are caused by underwater tectonic activity (movement of the earth's plates) and therefore occur along plate boundaries and as a result of earthquake and rise or fall in the sea floor, causing water to be displaced.</p>
